/**
 * The core package for the Java Pico wrapper.
 * 
 * The goal is to create an interface to the Pico file format that hides all
 * the inner details of the format and is <em>nearly</em> as fast as direct
 * native access to the raw bytes.
 * <p>
 * There are two major operations to support.
 * <ol>
 * <li>Writing data to a new file.</li>
 * <li>Reading data from an existing file.</li>
 * </ol>
 * 
 * For the first of these it makes sense to just open a channel, write the
 * data, and then close the channel.  For the second we need to provide random
 * access to the data.  To accomplish all this, we use the interfaces of the
 * {@code java.nio.channels} package.  We also provide implementations of
 * both {@code java.io.FileInputStream} and {@code java.io.FileOutputStream}
 * for simple sequential access wrapping some underlying stream.
 * <p>
 * For random access (read and write) use an instance of
 * {@link ornl.pico.io.PicoFile}.  To wrap an existing stream, or to provide
 * a stream to methods that expect one, use {@link ornl.pico.io.PicoInputStream}
 * and {@link ornl.pico.io.PicoOutputStream}.
